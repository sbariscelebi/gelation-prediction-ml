# Gelation Prediction in Copolymers using Deep Learning

This repository contains the source code for the study titled:  
**"Gelation Prediction in Copolymers Using Machine Learning Models"**, which employs deep learning techniques to predict gelation behavior in polymer systems based on compositional and physicochemical descriptors.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for model training, evaluation, SHAP explainability, and threshold optimization.
- `models/`: Saved ANN, CNN, and LSTM model files (HDF5 or similar format).
- `data/`: (Optional) Placeholder or link to dataset.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for reproducing the environment.

## ðŸ“Š Models
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation
Models are evaluated using F1-score, AUC, precision, recall, and accuracy.  
Threshold optimization and SHAP were used to improve and explain predictions.

## ðŸ“¥ Dataset
The dataset used in this study is publicly available at:
